## About the project

This is an android-based app for the Karumi's coding test.

It is a simple app with a login process. The user can input their credentials for them to be checked with the response of a fake API, simulating a request from a more complex database. If right, the app will create a session and redirect the user to a logout page. This session is stored locally and kept through app and even phone reboots.


## Built with

The entire app was made using Android Studio 4.0.1. All coding was made in Java.

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)


## Getting started

You can try this app on any Android device with version 4.1 or higher. Just [download the apk package](https://github.com/iripatx/KarumiTestAndroid/releases/latest) and install it. You may have to enable the *Allow installation from unknown sources* option.

If you don't have a device with such specifications, you can also run it on the Android Studio's Emulator. Learn how to set it up [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).


## Usage guide

Once the app is opened, you can introduce an email and a password in the designated fields, then press login to access. 

You can access the app as **test@karumi**.**com** with the password **potato**.

## Note for the reviewers
As you will be able to see in the project's issues, I was not able to enforce or even check code coverage for this project. I am aware this is a significant shortcoming. This aspect of programming is totally new to me and, while I consider myself a good self-teacher, I didn't manage to learn it by myself, at least in the time I dedicated to it. I also want this to be a transparent work, and I don't want to look like I know something I don't. I'd be happy to learn what is needed, but I understand that this is one of the requirements and it has not been met.
